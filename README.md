# README

The directories here contain complimentary code written for my doctoral work. They contain functions, scripts, models etc. for which the full context is available in the published thesis.

The following are some very brief outlines for their content:

## ArduinoHITL
Contains part of the code that was used for testing some hardware integration (controller and servo) with the developed flight simulation.

## MQ9demo
Contains part of the code that was used for demonstraing the application of the 3d visualisation technique developed for the flight simulation.

## ParameterEstimation
Contains part of the code used for System Identification/Parameter Estimation work based on the recorded flight data from various simulation outputs. Various old code from the 90s has been transcribed to modern MATLAB and improved/updated to streamline the parameter estimation process.

## Pyramid
Contains example code written to explain the simple foundations based on which the complex visualisation techniques were proposed in the thesis.

## StallModelling
Contains parts of the code written to improve the stall modelling characterisitcs of the MATLAB/Simulink simulation. The functions provided allow for rapidly customising the stall modelling of the simulation based on any airfoil data.
